         <h3>Alien Database </h3>
        <p> Students can find the computer from the aliensâ€™ ship here. Because the alien ship is damaged, scientists decided to move the alien computer to the space station. It contains information about the aliens: their physiology, technology, home worlds, and history. Because the aliens had insufficient time to complete the translation of their computer database, only a limited amount of information is available. Students must sift through the information to identify the needs of each alien species. </p>

        <h3>Probe Design Center</h3>
        <p> This room contains lists and descriptions of real scientific equipment used in both past and future probe missions to investigate other worlds in our solar system. Students construct probes by making choices within four categories: probe type, communication, power source, and instruments. Budgetary constraints force students to consider their choices carefully and make compromises. Students review the probes they have built and decide which ones to actually send. Only probes that are launched show up in the Mission Control Center, where data from them is displayed. </p>

        <p> Raw data collected by the probes are displayed in this room. Students must interpret this data in order to turn it into information that they can use to develop their solution. As in all probe missions, malfunctions are possible, and poor planning can result in mission failure. </p>

        <h3>Notebook</h3>
        <p> Students use their notebook to collect and organize information useful in solving the problem. The notebook was deliberately designed not to allow students to cut and paste information contained in the rest of the program, meaning that students must type their own notes based on what they think is important enough to record. A feature of the notepad is that is changes during the course of problem solving. At the beginning of the problem solving process, the notepad is highly structured. As the student progresses to solve for habitats for the aliens the notebook becomes less structured.</p>
