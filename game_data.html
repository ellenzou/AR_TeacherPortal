        <p><em>Alien Rescue</em> begins with the Opening Scenario, the presentation of the problem situation. Students watch the Opening Scenario during the first class session. There are two layers to the interface of <em>Alien Rescue</em>. The first is the space station, Paloma, itself, which currently consists of four rooms: Alien Database, Probe Design Center, and Mission Control Center, each containing a tool students can use to gather information or do hypothesis testing. The Communications Center houses the content of the aliens’ message and a message from the Director of the Interstellar Relocation Commission in text form, and has a solution form for students to submit their recommendation for a new home and provide justifications. From the center of the space station, students can navigate to any room by using the arrow keys on their keyboard. <br><br>

        The second level of the interface overlays the space station lining at the bottom of the screen and consists of a series of tools. You may tell students to imagine that they are wearing goggles, and that the overlay represents tools that are available to them wherever they go in the environment. This overlay contains the following tools: Solar System Database, Missions Database, Notebook, Concepts Database, Spectra and Periodic Table. 
            <br><br>
            
            See below for the specifics of each room and all the tools provided by the game:

         <h4>Alien Database </h4>
        <p> Students can find the computer from the aliens’ ship here. Because the alien ship is damaged, scientists decided to move the alien computer to the space station. It contains information about the aliens: their physiology, technology, home worlds, and history. Because the aliens had insufficient time to complete the translation of their computer database, only a limited amount of information is available. Students must sift through the information to identify the needs of each alien species. </p>

        <h4>Probe Design Center</h4>
        <p> This room contains lists and descriptions of real scientific equipment used in both past and future probe missions to investigate other worlds in our solar system. Students construct probes by making choices within four categories: probe type, communication, power source, and instruments. Budgetary constraints force students to consider their choices carefully and make compromises. Students review the probes they have built and decide which ones to actually send. Only probes that are launched show up in the Mission Control Center, where data from them is displayed. </p>

        <h4>Mission Control Center </h4>
        <p> Raw data collected by the probes are displayed in this room. Students must interpret this data in order to turn it into information that they can use to develop their solution. As in all probe missions, malfunctions are possible, and poor planning can result in mission failure. </p>

        <h4>Notebook</h4>
        <p> Students use their notebook to collect and organize information useful in solving the problem. The notebook was deliberately designed not to allow students to cut and paste information contained in the rest of the program, meaning that students must type their own notes based on what they think is important enough to record. A feature of the notepad is that is changes during the course of problem solving. At the beginning of the problem solving process, the notepad is highly structured. As the student progresses to solve for habitats for the aliens the notebook becomes less structured.</p>

                     <p>There are six alien species in our game. Students should identify at least the following needs for each species.  If you have students compile a list of needs as a class, you may want to prompt them if they are missing any of the following. If students generate additional needs, make sure that they are accurate and that they actually represent a need rather than simply a characteristic of the species. These tables can also be downloaded <a href="documents/alien%20needs.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a> The comprehensive contents of the Alien Database can be downloaded <a href="documents/Contents of the Alien Computer.pdf" Target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

                      <p>This section provides a brief tutorial on the meaning of the data returned in the control room. Students are expected to interpret this data, and apply the information they gain to their development of a solution. It is not recommended that you teach students how to do this. Instead, let students try to figure out what these things mean on their own, then discuss their findings in class.<br>

                          A complete list of the data returned in the Mission Status Center is given in
