                        <strong>Note:</strong> For all the writing assignments, the answers provided here serve as examples of appropriate responses and are given here only to help you guide class discussions of these assignments. Students’ answers will vary from these, so if you grade these assignments, you must evaluate their responses individually.<br><br>
                    
                        <strong>Assignment:</strong> <em>Write a problem statement.  You should explain what the problem is and what caused it. Also, explain what conditions make it difficult to solve.  This should be approximately 100 words long.</em><br><br>
                            
                       <strong>Example Solution:</strong> The aliens need to find new homes, or they will die.  They cannot find these homes for themselves because their ship was damaged.  Their computer cannot search for homes, and their life support is not working.  They are in suspended animation, and cannot wake up until they get to their new homes.  They want us to find homes for them, but before we can we need to figure out what they need and find worlds that match their needs.<br><br>

    <h2>Worksheet #2: The Aliens</h2>
    </a>
    
    <div class="detail">        
        <p>The purpose of this sheet is to focus students' attention on which facts about the aliens are relevant to identifying a home for them. Students should recognize that while some of the facts given about a species may be accurate, only the facts that represent a survival need are useful in solving the problem. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>In the first part of this worksheet, students should use the alien computer to determine which facts are correct about each species. They should check the following items:

    <h2>Worksheet #3: Worlds in our Solar System</h2>
    </a>
    
    <div class="detail">
     
        
<p>Four versions of this worksheet are provided.&#160; It is recommended that you use all four sheets, but give only one sheet to each student.&#160; In this way, a quarter of the class receives each sheet.&#160; Different students become "experts" on different worlds, and are able to share their knowledge with their classmates.&#160; This also prevents students from becoming bogged down in filling out several pages. 

</p><p>The purpose of this worksheet is to get students thinking about the key characteristics that scientists use to describe a world.&#160; This worksheet also focuses students on creating lists rather than writing lengthy descriptions.&#160; You should suggest that students take similar notes in their notebooks on each world they study. 

</p><p>When you go over the worksheets with the class, it is recommended that you only go over one world for each of the sheets&#160; so that each student has an opportunity to contribute without the discussion becoming too long.&#160; Attempt to engage students in discussing science concepts as you use this sheet rather than just focusing on the right answers.&#160; Good topics for discussion include temperature scales and how to convert between them, gravity, what a magnetic field does for a world, and the reasons for seismic activity. 
 
</p><p>Detailed information about each world is provided within the Solar System Database Section <!--link--> of The World of <em>Alien Rescue</em> <!--link-->of this digital manual. <br><br>

    <div class="detail">
      <p>Four versions of this sheet are provided. You may wish to use two for guided practice and two for a quiz.</p> 
       
      <p> The purpose of this worksheet is to help students to recognize that every probe should have a mission - a need for specific information, and that they must deal with constraints in order to design a probe that does not malfunction.  When you go over these worksheets with the class, discuss how scientists design instruments to gather data that they want to collect.  This is also a good time to get students to describe what type of data each instrument can collect. </p>

    <h2>Worksheet #6: How Scientists Work</h2>
    </a>
    
    <div class="detail">
        <p><strong>Assignment:</strong></p> 
        <p><em>How do scientists work?  Think about how you have been working during <em>Alien Rescue</em> and consider how it is similar to the way you think scientists work.  On the back of this sheet, list at least four different facts you think describe how scientists work.  For each fact, explain what you mean and why you think it’s important.</em></p>
        <p><strong> Example Solution:</strong> </p>
        <p>
        1. &nbsp; Scientists collaborate. By working together, they can get more done and combine skills. <br>

        2. &nbsp; Scientists make hypotheses. These hypotheses guide their investigation.<br>

        3. &nbsp; Scientists rarely get it right the first time. They make many mistakes and learn from each one.<br>

        4.&nbsp; Scientists always back up their opinions with facts and data.  They never simply say they believe something without being able to explain why, and this helps them be trusted.<br>

        5. &nbsp; Scientists publish their findings. In this way they add to what other scientists know. Others build on this information. </p><br>

    <h2>Worksheet #7: Interpreting Data</h2>
    </a>
    
    <div class="detail">
      <p> The purpose of this worksheet is to get students to take raw data and turn it into information they can apply to developing a solution.   Discussion of this worksheet can again focus on characteristics scientists consider when they study a world, including atmospheric density and composition, magnetic field, and seismic activity.  Or, you can focus on reviewing the types of data each instrument included in the probe design room collects.</p>

 

<p>Students' answers should have two parts - an interpretation of the data and some application of it to the problem.  The following are sample responses, though students may come up with a rich variety of applications. </p>

 

<p><strong>Picture 1: Barometer reading taken on Titan</strong> This is a completed example to help students understand the desired format of their response.<br><br>

 

<strong>Picture 2: Barometer reading taken on Callisto</strong> Callisto has a very thin atmosphere (1/100 of Earth's atmosphere).  This would make it a poor choice for a species like the Wroft who need a thick atmosphere, but it might be alright for other species who need less of an atmosphere, like the Akona and the Sylcari.<br><br>

 

<strong>Picture 3: Magnetometer reading for Jupiter</strong> Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field.  This would make it a poor choice for the Wroft because magnetic fields are dangerous for them.<br><br>

 

<strong>Picture 4: Magnetometer reading for Mars</strong> Mars has a weak magnetic field, but it would be enough to protect the surface from the solar wind.  This means the Eolani could live there.<br><br>

 

<strong>Picture 5: Seismograph reading from Deimos</strong> Deimos has very little seismic activity.  The Eolani, Kaylid, and Akona all need to find worlds with low seismic activity, so this might be a good home for them.<br><br>

 

<strong>Picture 6: Seismograph reading from Io</strong>  Io has strong earthquakes.  Only a species who can survive earthquakes, like the Wroft, Jakala-Tay, or Sylcari, could live there.<br><br>

 

<strong>Picture 7: Spectrograph reading on Neptune</strong>  Neptune has hydrogen, helium, and methane.  Since methane has carbon in it, this might be a good home for the Wroft.<br><br>

    <h2>Worksheet #8: Science Topics</h2>
    </a>
    
    <div class="detail">
       <p><strong>Assignment:</strong> <em>Pick four of the topics listed here and write what you know about them.  Make sure you write at least two or three sentences about each.  Continue on the back of this sheet.</em></p>
            
        <p><strong>Example Solution:</strong></p>
            
           <p> <strong>Temperature Scales:</strong> There are three temperature scales: Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.  In the Celsius scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees.  In the Kelvin scale, zero stands for absolute zero, the point where molecules stop moving.  To change Celsius to Kelvin, add 273.</p>
            
           <p> <strong>Craters:</strong>  Craters are formed when a meteorite hits the ground.  Atmospheres, liquid water, and volcanic eruptions can fill in craters.  If a world has a lot of craters, it means that its surface has not changed in millions of years.  We can conclude that those worlds don’t have atmospheres, liquid water, or active volcanoes.</p>
        
           <p> <strong>Gravity:</strong>   Gravity is a force.  The more mass an object has, the greater its gravity.  If we go to a world with less gravity than we are used to we can jump higher and move more easily than on Earth.  We would also weigh less.  If we went to a world with higher gravity, we would find it difficult to move. </p>
            
           <p> <strong>Seismic Activity:</strong> If a world has a liquid core and a hard surface, then pressure can build up, and this can make the surface shake.  The result is earthquakes.  Volcanoes are also the result of seismic activity.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Atmospheres:</strong>  An atmosphere is a blanket of gases that surrounds a world.  Atmospheres can be made up of many different types of gases, and the atmospheres of other worlds are different from Earth’s.  A barometer can be used to measure the atmospheric pressure.  Small worlds, like Phobos and Deimos, don’t have enough gravity to hold onto an atmosphere. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Magnetic Fields:</strong> If a world has a liquid metalic core, then it creates a magnetic field around that world.  A magnetic field can protect a world from the solar wind.  The solar wind is made up of particles blown off of the sun.  If Earth did not have a magnetic field, life would not be possible because of the solar wind. </p>

    </a>
    
    <div class="detail">
      <p>Though much of the focus of <em>Alien Rescue</em> is on problem-solving, students should learn a great deal of factual knowledge through their work on this program. It is recommended that you review this test early enough in the program to make sure that class discussions address each of the topics covered in the test.<br><br>
             
        A factual knowledge test is provided. This is the full test that is recommended for most students. This test has 24 items. The last five items on this test are the most difficult, so you may wish to eliminate these items if you decide they are too difficult for your students.
