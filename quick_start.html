      <p>Welcome to <em>Alien Rescue</em>, a multimedia enhanced program designed to engage middle school students in complex problem solving.</p>
      
      <br>
      <p>A group of six species of aliens, fleeing their own destroyed planetary system, have arrived in Earth’s orbit. Their ship was damaged during their voyage, and except for their engines and computer databases, little of their technology continues to function. In order to survive, they must find new homes on worlds that can support their life forms. </p> <br>
         <p> Students are informed that they are young scientists participating in this rescue operation, and that their task is to determine the most suitable relocation site for each alien species. In order to solve this problem, students must engage in a variety of activities. They will perform these activities aboard the space station Paloma, wherein they must learn about the aliens and identify the basic needs of each species using cognitive tools to research scientific principles, form and test hypotheses, and gather data.</p>

     <h4 class="pinline7" id="quicktour"><span>Quick Tour of <em>Alien Rescue</em></span></h4>
<div id="quicktour_p">
    <p>There is no one ‘correct’ strategy to use <em>Alien Rescue</em>; it is an open environment that encourages students to freely discover, explore, and make mistakes. What follows is an example of one possible strategy to navigate the program. Note: Use the arrow keys for all navigation in the space station. Use the mouse to select the tools from the popup menu at the bottom of the screen. </p>
<br>

    <p>1. Go to Research lab, open Alien Database, study the needs of the alien species and take notes using Notebook tool.</p><br>
    
   <p> 2. Open Solar System Database, study the planets and take notes. Compare what an alien species needs with what a planet’s data.</p><br>
    
    <p>3. The data from the Alien and Solar System databases are intentionally incomplete. Go to Probe Design room to design a probe and launch it to gather additional data.</p><br>
   
    <p>4. Study the data returned by the probe you sent. <strong>Be careful:</strong> suboptimal probe designs can result in a malfunction. <strong>Note:</strong> probes cost money and there are limited funds. </p><br>
    
    <p>5. Once you have sufficient evidence to evaluate a hypothesis for a new home planet, activate the Message Tool and submit your Solution.</p><br>

        <h4>Age Level</h4>
                  <p><em>Alien Rescue</em> is targeted for 6th graders. However, with proper adjustment from the teachers, it has been used with 5th through 9th graders. The <a href="teacher_manual.html"> Teaching with <em>Alien Rescue</em></a> section provides essential information for making this adjustment.</p>

                   <h4>Structured Problem </h4>  
                  <p><em>Alien Rescue</em> engages students in developing a solution to an ill-structured problem. This allows students the opportunity to deal with a complex problem where they must identify their own learning needs and discriminate among several viable options. Students develop the skills they need to deal with problems they encounter in the real world. </p>

                  <p><em>Alien Rescue</em> focuses primarily on space science, but also draws on knowledge from a variety of curriculum areas in order to simulate the solving of complex problems in real life. It addresses <a href="documents/Alignment%20of%20Alien%20Rescue%20with%20NGSS.pdf" target="_blank"> Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)</a> and aligns closely with <a href="documents/TEKS_AlienRescue.pdf" target="_blank"> Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</a>. </p>
