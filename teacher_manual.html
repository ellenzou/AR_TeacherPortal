                     <p>A multimedia enhanced program designed to engage middle school students in complex problem-solving, <em>Alien Rescue</em> requires students to gain specific knowledge about both our solar system and the tools and procedures scientists use to study it. <em>Alien Rescue</em> is designed to be used in a classroom setting, with students working together to help each other deal with the complexity of the problem situation. </p>
                     <p>Through the use of a science fiction premise <em>Alien Rescue</em> takes students to a newly operational international space station where they become part of a worldwide effort to rescue alien life forms. The program begins with a presentation of a complicated problem which students, acting as scientists, are asked to participate in solving.</p>

                <h3 id="oneintro">The Story</h3>
  
  <p> A group of six species of aliens, fleeing their own planetary system, have arrived in Earth's orbit. Their ship was damaged during their voyage, and except for their engines and computer databases, little of their technology continues to function. In order to survive, they must find new homes on worlds that can support their life forms. Having picked up Earth broadcasts, the aliens learned our languages with the intention of asking for our help to relocate to worlds in our solar system. However, when their life support failed completely, the aliens could only complete a distress message to be sent once they reached Earth's orbit. They then entered a state of suspended animation, where they must remain until they are safely relocated to suitable worlds.</p> 
 <br><br>
  
    <h3 id="twointro">The Mission</h3>
  
        <p> Students are informed that they are young scientists participating in this rescue operation, and that their task is to determine the most suitable relocation site for each alien species. In order to solve this problem, students must engage in a variety of activities. They must learn about the aliens and identify the basic needs of each species. They must then investigate the planets and moons of our solar system, searching them for possible matches with the needs of the aliens. Students gather this information in two ways: they conduct research using the Solar System Database <!--link to Solar System DB screencast!-->, and they design and launch probes <!--link to probe design probes; include probe image !--> that they have constructed to gather additional information not available in the database. Students must also engage in collaborative planning and decision-making as they determine how to use the resources of the solar system effectively.

        <p><em>Alien Rescue</em> is an open environment. While there are several tasks students must complete in order to develop a solution, and a logical order in which to complete these tasks, students may generate alternative paths to solution. The following lesson plans therefore include a fair amount of flexibility and are designed to provide support for you the first time you use <em>Alien Rescue</em> with your class. With experience you will quickly come to see alternative paths which emphasize different skills and information. You should modify these plans to best suit the needs of your class and demands of your curriculum.<br><br>
        The following lesson plans assume 45-minute periods for 15 days, with an extra day away from the computers for a wrap-up session. They will need to be adjusted accordingly for different length class periods. </p>

        <p>As the classroom teacher, your role in <em>Alien Rescue</em> is that of a facilitator. Students take the lead in determining the tasks they must complete in order to develop a solution plan; your job is to support them as they engage in these tasks. The following suggestions should give you an idea of ways you can interact with students to facilitate their work during <em>Alien Rescue</em>.</p>

              <p>
                <h3 id="oneteach">Facilitation Tips</h3>
  
  
                <ul>
                        <li><strong> Allow students to determine what they need to know in order to develop a solution.</strong> <br>In most instructional activities, it is the teacher who sets objectives and determines how these objectives will be met. <em>Alien Rescue</em>is designed so that, in the course of their work, students realize they need certain skills and information. They are the ones who determine what they must learn. </li><br>


                        <li><strong>Encourage students to use the resources within <em>Alien Rescue</em> to find the information they need.</strong> <br>Much of what students need to know to develop a solution can be found within the program. When they realize they lack skills or information they need, they may be tempted to turn to you immediately for help, asking the familiar question “What do I do now?” However, <em>Alien Rescue</em> provides an excellent opportunity to encourage students to be self-reliant. When students ask questions, don’t provide the answers. Instead, ask them what they have done to try to find the answer on their own, refer them to their classmates, or guide them through questioning to find helpful resources.</li><br>


                        <li><strong>Ask questions designed to get students to articulate their reasons for needing particular information.</strong><br> A frequent question heard in schools is “Why do we need to know this?” Usually it is a student doing the asking. <em>Alien Rescue</em> gives you the opportunity to turn the table on students, and have them explain the value of particular skills and information. This also helps students to see knowledge as a tool that can be used to accomplish tasks and solve problems.</li><br>


                        <li><strong>Encourage discussion and debate among students.</strong> <br> Successful work during <em>Alien Rescue</em> depends on students providing each other with information and ideas, and catching each other's mistakes. During whole class discussion and presentations, encourage students to review and critique the information presented.</li><bR>


                        <li><strong>Don't be passive.</strong><br> Just because you are not taking charge of students' work does not mean that your role is not an important one. In fact, you are the one who is going to turn a rich opportunity into a successful learning experience. Ask probing questions, engage students in one-on-one discussions about their process and understanding. Bring interesting facts into class discussions. Encourage collaboration. Support students who are having trouble by brainstorming with them ways they can address their difficulties. Simple questions like "What are you working on? Why are you doing that? How are you doing that?" can get students to articulate their ideas and processes. Your involvement will make a huge difference in the quality of students' experience in <em>Alien Rescue</em>.</li>

    <h3 id="twoteach">The Teacher as Facilitator: A Few Examples</h3>
  
        <p>The following are a few situations that typically arise during <em>Alien Rescue</em>. For each, advice is offered on how you can effectively facilitate without taking control of students’ work.</p>  
  
    <br><h3 id="threeteach">Situation 1:</h3>
  
        <p>A student is reading about an alien species from the alien computer and encounters a picture of some colored lines. You recognize it as a spectrum, but she does not know what it is or what to do with it. She asks you to explain it to her.</p>


            <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Encourage the student to ask her classmates if they know what it means, or to try and figure it out on her own. Follow up the latter by telling her that if she does figure it out that she should share that information with the class at the next class discussion. This is an easy problem that students can handle without your help if you allow/insist that they do so. By not telling students how to interpret a spectrum, you give one or more students within the class the opportunity to be the expert, and you encourage students to look upon their peers as resources in solving a problem.</p><br>
            <br><a href="#teachingtop">Back to top</a>
  
    <h3 id="fourteach">Situation 2:</h3>
    
        <p>Five of your students seem to be obsessed with getting the authorization code to increase the funding level so that they can launch more probes. However, they have not given attention to data sent back by the probes they have already launched.</p>


        <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Ask your students to study the data sent back by the probes and figure out what else they need to find a home for the alien species they are working on. Ask them to learn about the species’ needs and read the solar system database to learn about worlds in our solar system. Refuse to increase their funding level until they are able to justify that they truly need more funding to launch another probe. Through class discussions students should come to understand that real world scientists only receive funding when they can justify it. Insist that they meet this same standard. As other students who have done this research receive funding, these students will fall into line and do what it takes to get funding themselves.</p>
        <br><a href="#teachingtop">Back to top</a>    
  
    <h3 id="fiveteach">Situation 3:</h3>
  
        <p>It is the third day of class and one student is floundering, wandering aimlessly through the program, not taking notes, and not seeming to be engaged in any meaningful activity. He doesn’t seem unhappy or disinterested, but he doesn’t seem to know what to do or even to recognize that he needs a plan.</p>


        <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Being a facilitator doesn’t mean that you should be a passive observer. If a student is floundering, you should provide support, just not to the point where you take over. Ask the student what he is doing or what steps he thinks he should go through to solve the problem. He probably won’t have an answer, but asking the question may get him thinking about what he should do. Encourage him to find out what his classmates are doing, then tell him you will be back in fifteen minutes to discuss what he plans to do and why he thinks it will be useful. Again, class discussions will help with this problem. As you get some students to articulate what they are doing and why they are doing it, less-focused students will hear ideas that can guide their work.</p>
        <br><a href="#teachingtop">Back to top</a>    
  
    <h3 id="sixteach">Situation 4:</h3>
  
        <p>When students are given an open-ended notebook (after they find a home for 3 species), a hardworking student is writing a lot of notes in his notebook. If fact, it looks like he is practically copying whole paragraphs.</p>


        <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Question the student about why he is doing that. Prompt him how the notebook he used earlier is different. Bring up the issue of note taking in a class discussion, and discuss what are the different versions of notebook in <em>Alien Rescue</em> students have seen so far, how they are different in structure, and what the information are available and not available in the early version of the notebook. Ask students what types of information they think should be recorded in the open-ended notebook. Discuss the importance of recording key pieces of information as prompted in the early versions of the notebook. Suggest to use bullets to write only the most important and relevant one. It is hoped the early versions of the notebook will help guide the students to do note taking more effectively.</p>
        <br><a href="#teachingtop">Back to top</a>   
  
    <h3 id="seventeach">Situation 5:</h3>
  
        <p>A student keeps requesting more funding for designing probes. When you ask her what she learned from the probes she already launched, she tells you that she had a lot of malfunctions. She doesn’t know why these malfunctions occurred, and doesn’t seem to understand that they are the result of design flaws.</p>


        <p> <strong>Advice:</strong> The problem here is that the student lacks a basic concept: she doesn’t know that there are constraints in how a probe can be built. Help her to recognize that not all instruments work on all probes. Encourage her to work with another student who has launched successful probes. In class discussions, get students to articulate the reasons for design decisions. For example, elicit comments like “You can put a seismograph on a flyby because it has to land on the surface of a world in order to measure earthquakes” and “You have to use a thermoelectric generator to go to Uranus because it’s too far from the sun for a battery to work.” Before giving this student further funding, insist that she articulate her reasons for certain design decisions.</p>  
        <br><a href="#teachingtop">Back to top</a> 
  
    <h3 id="eightteach">Grouping</h3>
  
        <p>The central problem of <em>Alien Rescue</em> is complex; this complexity encourages students to rely on their classmates as sources of support. Seeing students spontaneously engaging in scientific discussion and debate can be one of the most gratifying aspects of the program for you as their teacher. To facilitate collaboration, you can either assign students to groups or allow them to initiate the collaboration themselves. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Teacher-directed grouping.</strong> Some teachers prefer to assign students to pairs or small groups to work together throughout the program. To facilitate this you can assign two students to share a computer or assign students at neighboring computers to work together. You can either assign them to divide up work in a certain way, or can suggest that they divide the work and leave it to the students to determine how.</li><br>

                        <li><strong>Student-directed collaboration.</strong> <em>Alien Rescue</em> offers an excellent opportunity for giving control over collaboration to your students. To facilitate this, do not assign students teammates. Instead, try these three tactics:</li><br>
                    </ul>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Early in the program, ask students to stop and look around the classroom. Tell them to find someone who is looking at a screen they haven’t seen yet and ask that person to show them where they found it.</li><br>
                    
                        <li>When students get stuck on something, encourage them to ask their neighbors rather than giving them help yourself. Even if the other students don’t know the answer, it will get them talking and relying on each other.</li><br>
                    
                        <li>Some students will naturally start working together. Ask them to share their reasons for doing so during class discussions, and continue to stress the benefits of collaboration.</li><br>
                    </ol>
                    <a href="#teachingtop">Back to top</a>
 
     <h3 id="nineteach">Physical Arrangements</h3>
  
                        <p>The lesson plans given <!--link!--> on two physical configurations of the class during <em>Alien Rescue</em>: "class discussion" and "at computers." The "class discussion" configuration applies to those times when the class gathers to share and reflect on information. If possible, provide some means by which students can record information they discover and want to share with the class. A white board, a chalkboard, or large piece of bulletin board paper tacked to the wall or laid out on a table will all work well. If you are using <em>Alien Rescue</em> with multiple classes, you may want to use bulletin board paper so that each class can make its own records. Students should be away from their computers and close enough to the white board to see the information recorded there.<br>

                        In the second configuration, students are working at their computers. Computers should be placed in close enough proximity that teams can easily discuss their work and provide support for each other. If there are headphones available, you may want to allow students to use them, but be sure to talk to them about taking them off when they are not listening to the opening scenario. Headphones can isolate students and discourage collaboration.</p>                    <br><a href="#teachingtop">Back to top</a>
    
    <h3 id="tenteach">Grades</h3>
  
                    <p>Because <em>Alien Rescue</em> can be used in a variety of ways and different aspects of it can be emphasized, it is up to you as a classroom teacher to determine how you want to evaluate students’ work. The following are a few possibilities:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Participation.</strong> Periodically as students work, record on-task behavior, ability to answer questions during one-on-one interactions you have with the students, and contributions to class and team discussions. You can also ask students to evaluate their own and their teammates’ contributions to the project.</li><br>

                            <li><strong>Optional worksheets.</strong> <!--link!-->The Worksheets and Tests <!--can we link to a tab?-->tab contains a number of worksheets. While most of these should be used in class when students have access to <em>Alien Rescue</em>, the four writing assignments can be completed as homework or as independent class work. While appropriate answers are provided in this tab, you will need to determine a method for assigning grades to any worksheets you decide to use.</li><br>

                            <li><strong>Presentations.</strong> Students can use an application like PowerPoint to create presentations on worlds in our solar system, science concepts, or their choices of worlds for the aliens. You can use this activity to get all of students to share their solutions and discuss their findings. Or you can assign this only to students who work faster than others and need the additional challenge. If you decide to grade presentations, you will need to develop a rubric to assess students' work.</li><br>


                            <li><strong>Science Concept Test.</strong> A factual knowledge test is provided in The Worksheets and Tests <!--can we link to a tab?-->tab. This is the full test that is recommended for most students. This test has 24 items. The last five items on this test are the most difficult, so you may wish to eliminate these items if you decide they are too difficult for your students.</li> <br>


                            <li><strong>Problem-Solving Test.</strong>  A two part activity that offers a similar problem to the one presented in <em>Alien Rescue</em> is included in the The Worksheets and Tests <!--can we link to a tab?-->tab. Suggestions for grading this test are provided as well.</li>
                        </ul>
        <a href="#teachingtop">Back to top</a> 
   
<h3 id="eleventeach">Building Connections to Other Areas of the Curriculum</h3>

<br><h3 id="twelveteach">Math</h3>
  
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Using formulas to convert between temperature scales.</strong> In <em>Alien Rescue</em>, the aliens give temperature information in Kelvin, while the solar system database uses Celsius. To accurately determine which worlds are viable for each species, students must convert between these two scales.<br>
                        
                        To convert Temperature (T) from Kelvin to Celcius and from Celcius to Kelvin, instruct students to use the following formulas respectively:
                        <p><strong>
                            <i>T</i><sub>(&deg;C)</sub>=<i>T</i><sub>(K)</sub>-273.15.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong><i>T</i><sub>(K)</sub>=<i>T</i><sub>(&deg;C)</sub>+273.15.</strong></p>
                            </li><br>

                        <li><strong>Converting between fractions and decimals.</strong> The aliens report the gravitational pull of their worlds using fractions (with the surface gravity of Earth = 1), which the solar system database reports information about our worlds in decimals. To successfully determine which worlds have similar surface gravity levels, students need to convert between fractions and decimals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <a href="#teachingtop">Back to top</a>

    <h3 id="thirteenteach">Language Arts</h3>
  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Writing persuasive essays.</strong> The recommendation form in <em>Alien Rescue</em> requires students to provide a rationale for each of their choices of worlds for the aliens. The purpose of this rationale is to persuade officials to follow their recommendations. Lessons within the language arts class could focus on writing appropriate topic sentences and supporting details within a persuasive essay.</li><br>


                <li><strong>Creating a brochure.</strong> The following assignment can be modified in many ways. Tell students to pretend that it is 100 years from now and that tourism companies are selling tours to visit the aliens on their new homeworlds. Have students pick one species and create a brochure describing its colony, its way of life, and details about its new homeworld (these should be scientifically accurate). After writing the copy, students can create pictures to illustrate the brochures.</li>

<h3 id="fourteenteach">Tips on Using <em>Alien Rescue</em> with Your Students</h3>
  
        <ul>
                <li><strong>Hold a class discussion everyday.</strong> Skipping a class discussion, even when your students are anxious to get into the program, means a missed opportunity for learning.</li><br>


                <li><strong>For the class discussions, have a list of probing questions ready to use if necessary.</strong> Start the class discussions by asking students to raise issues. Chances are some of their questions will address the issues you want to bring out in discussion, but be prepared to introduce other topics yourself.</li><br>
    
                <li><strong>While students are at their computers, engage them individually in discussion of their work.</strong> Getting students to articulate their problem-solving process and their understanding of science content can enhance their learning, so spend as much time as you can circulating around the room and talking to students. When students request funding to launch probes, insist that they explain some aspect of the task, such as offering a hypothesis, explaining how the instruments they chose fit their mission, or the reason for malfunctions on previous missions. Suggestions on how to use the launch codes to promote learning are provided in the Lesson Plans.</li><br>


                <li><strong>Protect the additional funding codes. DO NOT LET STUDENTS FIND OUT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING CODES.</strong> If they do, they will begin launching probes indiscriminately, and you will not be able to hold them back or get them to reflect on their design.</li><br>


            <li><strong>Refer to the <a href="documents/Solution_Form_&_Rubric_For_Grading_Solutions.pdf" target="_blank"> Solution Form &amp; Rubric For Grading Solutions.</a></strong> This sheet is designed to offer you, the teacher, quick access to information you'll need during <em>Alien Rescue</em>. DO NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO SEE THIS SHEET. It provides the codes for the different levels of funding and additional information.</li>

        <p>Throughout <em>Alien Rescue</em> you should have an opportunity to tie students comments to key scientific concepts. For your convenience, some information is provided here on several topics that might come up during class discussions. Hover over each picture to see a quick look of that discussion's info! Use this information to enrich class discussions, but resist the temptation to lecture students or overwhelm them with more information than they can handle. </p>

        <p>During your time using <em>Alien Rescue</em> and studying our solar system and its related concepts, you may wish to supplement gameplay with worksheets, activites, and tests of what students have learned. This section provides these resources. As well, suggested responses and grading guidelines for these worksheets and writing assignments are provided here. Reproducible worksheets follow this section. <br>

This section contains four worksheet activities that you can use in class, and four writing tasks that you can use either in class or as a homework assignment. At the end of this section, you will find tests of factual knowledge and problem-solving abilit. They are arranged in the suggested order for their use. Each section contains links within the title and/or section description printable versions of each worksheet and solution form (where provided). </p>

                      <p>The following is a list of worlds that are acceptable for each species. While some of them have drawbacks (see the elimination chart on the next two pages) you should consider these as good answers. Remember, students may fail to identify some of the needs of the species, or may not recognize one of the drawbacks of a given world. Getting the correct answer is not that important. Even students who make poor choices for the aliens can learn a great deal about problem-solving, the work of scientists, and science concepts through their work on <em>Alien Rescue</em>.</p>
