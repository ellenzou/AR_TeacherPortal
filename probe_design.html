<p>Flyby</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>A flyby is used to explore many worlds with one probe. It takes a quick look at a world as it flies by. A flyby generally has less than 24 hours to gather information on a world as it zooms past. This means that it may not get a look at all parts of a world&rsquo;s surface.</p>

<p>An orbiter is used to gather information about one world. As it makes many orbits around the world it can gather detailed information about the entire surface and study the world&rsquo;s weather patterns.</p>

<p>Orbiter with Lander</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This probe has two parts: an orbiter which remains in orbit around a world, and a lander, which is dropped from the orbiter onto the world below. As the lander descends it can be used to study the atmosphere of a world, if one is present. A lander is protected with thick materials that cushion the instruments inside. This prevents the instruments from being damaged when the lander hits the surface of a world. A lander sends the data it collects to the orbiter. The orbiter then sends this data back to Earth.</p>

<p>Solar Panels</p>
</td>

<p>Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity. After launch, the panels unfold and provide power for the probe systems. They can also charge the batteries. Solar panels work only when the sun shines directly on them. The panels are ideal for missions that remain close to the sun, but beyond Jupiter other power sources may be needed if a probe is carrying more than two instruments.</p>

<p>High Gain Antenna</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Antennas act like the ears and voice of a probe, hearing instructions from Earth and sending back information. A high gain antenna sends a great deal of data in a focused beam back to Earth. This antenna must be pointed directly at the Earth in order for us to pick up its signal. Long range missions (beyond Mars) demand the big &ldquo;ears&rdquo; of a high gain antenna to send data back to Earth.<br /> </p>

<p>Low Gain Antenna</p>
</td>

<p>A low gain antenna can send only a small amount of information at one time, so it takes a long time for it to send all the data it collects. It does not need to be pointed at the Earth in order for us to pick up its signal. If a probe has a low gain antenna, we can communicate with it no matter what direction it is pointing. Low gain antennas can pick up commands sent from Earth even from great distances.<br /> </p>

<p><em>RADAR</em> stands for RAdio Detection And Ranging. Radar on board spacecraft allows us to see below thick atmospheres and map the surface terrain of a world. It does this by bouncing a radio signal off of the surface of a world then &ldquo;listening&rdquo; for its echo. Scientists use this to find features on a world, such as mountains, caves, and canyons, that are hidden by a cloudy atmosphere. It would be used only in orbiters and flybys.<br /> </p>
