                <h3 id="oneteach">Day 1  Become Acquainted With the Virtual Environment</h3>
  
  
                <p>Watch the Opening Scenario and become acquainted with the virtual environment. You may be tempted to provide “warm up” activities for students, such as telling them about the problem presented in <em>Alien Rescue</em> or discussing relevant vocabulary.Problem-based learning begins with the problem presentation. Students must sort the problem situation out for themselves and will acquire vocabulary naturally as they attempt to communicate about the problem. Students should spend the remainder of the day exploring the virtual environment. Allow students to discover as much as they can on their own, and encourage them to share discoveries with peers.Students must select a password when they first log on. Suggest that students write their passwords down or take a moment to memorize them. You may want to record the passwords students create. </p>

                <h3 id="twoteach">Day 2 Generate Questions About the Scenario & Explore the Virtual Space Station to Find Answers</h3>

                <p>Generate questions about the scenario and continue to explore the virtual space station to find answers.Start by asking what the problem is that students must solve. As students start to offer their ideas, ask a few questions about the events that created this problem.Here are a few examples:</p>

            
                <ul>
                  <li>Why do the aliens need new homes in the first place?</li>
                  <li>If a star explodes, doesn’t it destroy the surrounding planets quickly?</li>
                  <li>Why didn’t we simply bring the alien computer to Earth and work there? </li>
                    <li>Why are we working aboard the space station Paloma?  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>You should ask some questions to get the discussion going, but encourage students to think about the problem situation and generate their own questions. Also, do not answer any of the questions yourself. Record the questions students cannot answer on the white board and ask students to look for the answers as they work today.</p>
                    
                  
                <p>
                Students should continue to explore the space station environment, trying to find answers to any questions remaining after the group discussion. Allow students to explore as they see fit. 
                At some point during the day, ask students to look around the classroom to see what their classmates have discovered. Encourage them to request information from classmates that have discovered a part of the program they have not yet seen. By the middle of this class period, all students should have discovered that they can use the arrow keys on their keyboards to navigate the space station. Some students would launch dozens of probes without planning them or evaluating their effectiveness. To deal with this problem, students are provided a budget for launching probes. This budget should be sufficient for most students to gather enough information to solve the problem. However, there may be some students who will run out of money and <em>Alien Rescue</em> will then pop up a dialog box requesting a code for additional budget funds. Students will not be able to proceed until the code is provided.
                When this occurs ask them to consider the conditions under which they think scientists get funding to conduct research. Tell them that you will be discussing this in the next few days in class, and that you would like them to have some ideas to share at that time. Also, probe the student’s thinking about how to construct a probe and why. You may be able to help the student build probes within the new budget constraints.

                <h3 id="threeteach">Day 3-5 Discuss Problem-Solving Process &amp; Encourage Collaboration</h3>
    
                <p> Discuss students’ ideas about the process they will use to solve this problem. Discuss the value of collaboration and encourage it in class. Identify the needs of each of the alien species.While class discussions during <em>Alien Rescue</em> should be flexible and build on students’ comments and interests, in these early days you may need to direct the flow of conversation. Try to make sure to address the following issues: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><B>Problem Statement.</B> If you gave the writing assignment, let students share their statements. If not, make sure that students all understand the nature of the problem. Get students to describe what a solution will look like (a world for each alien species, for six worlds altogether). Also, if there were unanswered questions from previous discussions, ask students to share any pertinent information they discovered.</li><br>
                    <li><B>Problem-Solving Process.</B> Ask students how they think they will go about solving the problem. Get them to identify steps they will use in the process. Students may not clearly see their way through the entire process, but they should recognize that one of the first things they need to do is to figure out what the aliens need so they can find a world that matches those needs. Explain the importance of having a plan so as to work effectively and not waste time doing things that are not helpful. Encourage students to consider what they will do before they actually log on.</li><br>
                    <li><B>Collaboration. </B>Bring up the story of Dr. Frankenstein and the monster he created. Ask students if they can describe how he worked. Bring out of the discussion the idea that he worked almost alone, with only Igor to help him. Ask students if this is how scientists normally work. Get them to recognize that scientists usually work together, and explain how important it is for scientists to publish their findings. Get students to identify reasons for scientists to work together.</li><br>
                   
                </ul>

                    <p>
                    Circulate among students, asking them what they are doing and their reasons for doing it. Some students will not have answers. Ask them to stop for a moment and think of a plan before they proceed, or ask a neighbor what he or she is doing.
                    Students should spend most of these days reading about the alien species, and perhaps looking at the solar system database to find potential homes for each species. Many students will spend a substantial portion of days 3 and 4 looking at the probe design room. Through discussion, try to move them into an investigation of the alien species.Also, before they can actually launch a probe, they will have to prove to you that they know enough about the needs of a species and have identified a world where it can live. 
                    Encourage collaboration. When students ask you for help, tell them to ask their classmates. </p>


                    <p>After students have generated a list of the aliens’ needs, you may want to spend a day away to further refine these lists. You can use the 1st version of the notebook to display the lists students generated as a whole class discussion. You can also divide students into five groups and have each group refine the list for one of the species.</p>

                    <h3 id="sixteach">Day 6-8 Look For Possible Homes For the Species By Searching the Solar System Database & Begin Designing And Launching Probes</h3>
                    
                    <p> Look for possible homes for the species by searching the solar system database. Begin designing and launching probes. Discussion during these days will depend on what topics students bring up, so be flexible. You should try to touch on topics such as Probes,the Role of Hypotheses in the Scientific Method, Science Topics, Peer Modeling of Collaboration.</p>

                    <p>Tell students that you are circulating in a specific order and that they should have questions/requests ready for when you get to them. Students who are waiting for the authorization code will quickly become frustrated if they believe you will never get to them. Have students signal that they would like to talk to you by placing a marker on top of their monitors. That way, you only talk to students who want your attention.
                    You may feel that some students need some support but will require more time than you can give them. Ask students who seem to be on track to spend ten minutes working with them. Continue to encourage collaboration.</p>

                    <h3 id="nineteach">Day 9-11 Develop And Test Hypotheses & Interpret Findings And Apply Them To the Problem</h3>
                    <p> Continue to develop hypotheses and test them by launching probes. Continue to interpret data gathered from probe missions and apply findings to the problem. Discuss the design of probes and the types of tools scientists use to gather data. Again, discussions will vary based on the topics students bring up. Try to touch on the following topics during these days: Students’ Problem Solving Process,Effective Design of Probes,Data from Mission Status Center,Science Topics. </p>

                        
                      <p>
                     Students should be launching probes and analyzing data most of the time, though they will still be using other program features flexibly as they see fit. Now that they have gotten some funding, things tend to become less hectic. You will need to continue to give funding, but you should have more time for extended one-on-one interactions with students. You may want to use this time to get students who are normally quiet during class discussions to articulate their reasoning for their work. </p>
                            
      <a href="#oneteach">Back to top</a>   
  
                      <h3 id="twelveteach">Day 12-14 Discuss And Finalize Decisions & Write Rationales For These Decisions</h3>
  
                      <p>Discuss and finalize decisions about where to send each alien species. Write rationales for these decisions in the recommendation form.Students may begin to feel pressured to finish, so they may want to spend less time in class discussion. Try to preserve discussion time, even if it means adding an extra day to the unit. The following are some topics to address: How Scientists Work, Deadline and Solution Requirements, Proposed Solutions,Science Topics. </p>
                          
                        
                      <p>
                      All students should have launched several probes, it is time for students to begin submitting recommendations. On these days, the students should spend most of their time working on the recommendation form. They will need to go to other parts of the program to check their work, so they will be using various tools flexibly as they see fit. Engage students during these days in discussion of their recommendations, asking to see their forms and read their rationales. Seeing you emphasize this will help to move students still intent on launching probes forward to working on their solutions. It will also give you a chance to give one-on-one guidance and feedback, and help address any misconceptions students may have.
                       </p>

                      <h3 id="fifteenteach">DAY 15 Finalize Entries in the Recommendation Form And Submit It</h3>
  
                      <p>Finalize entries in the recommendation form and submit it. Teacher leads discussion of students’ solutions. The class can view the ending scene of <em>Alien Rescue</em> (1-min: <a href="https://vimeo.com/90817308">http://vimeo.com/90817308</a>). Like the introduction to problem video, this is meant for you to show to class together on the last day to wrap up your AR. You can use it along with your class presentation/discussion. It does not provide answers to the problem (intentional).


                          
                      Prior to class, make sure you have studied the <a href="documents/Elimination_Chart1.pdf" target="_blank"> elimination chart</a> (also available in the Solutions and Codes section of <a href="teacher_manual.html">Teaching with <em>Alien Rescue</em></a> and <a href="prints.html">Printable Pages and Documents</a> In particular, make sure you understand how to use the elimination chart, and are comfortable enough with it that you can use it easily during the class discussion. Save twenty minutes to discuss students’ solutions. This should be a fun class. Call on one student to pick which species to discuss. Allow students to call out their solutions, and then tell them which worlds are the best choices and which ones are acceptable, but less ideal. If some students have selected a world that is clearly a poor choice, make sure that the problems with that world are pointed out. Continue with the other species until all are done.
                      Throughout this discussion, make sure that you communicate that there is no single right answer for each species. Rather, there are multiple good choices, as well as many not-so-good and downright poor choices. Make sure that the quality of a choice is judged by the ability to support it with facts, not by personal preferences. </p>
                          
                         
                      <p>
                      During the first twenty minutes of class, have students log on and make sure they have submitted their recommendation forms. If they do not, you will have no record of the rationales they wrote. Therefore, tell students to make sure they select a world for each species, and then submit the form even if they have not completed writing the rationales. Most students can finish in this amount of time, but if not, you will need to decide if and how to provide students additional time with the program.
                      Ask students to review which world they chose for each species, as you will discuss it after they have logged out of the program.
                       </p>

                      <h3 id="sixteenteach">Day 16 Helping Students Reflect On And Share Their Learning Experiences & Administer the Science Test</h3>
  
                       <p>Debrief the students by helping them to reflect on their experiences and share their learning. Administer <a href="documents/Science_Test_1_01.pdf" target="_blank">the science test</a> if desired.

                          
                      The entire day is discussion, so students do not need access to computers. In you gave the writing assignment listed above, go through the list asking students to share what they have learned about various science topics. If you plan to study any of these topics in depth later in the year, point that out to students so that they make the connection. After discussing science topics, engage students with more general questions. Here are a few examples: What did you think of <em>Alien Rescue</em>? Was this an effective way to learn science? Do you think the way you worked resembled the way scientists work? In what ways? How was it different? Are any of you considering a career in science? If so, do you have a clearer idea now of what scientists do? Can you think of any real world situations where you might have a similar problem to solve? Did you learn any lessons in problem-solving? If so, what? </p>
                          
                         
                      <p>
                      The science test answers are available <a href="documents/science%20conceptstest_Answer_01.pdf">here</a>. Make sure that you understand the directions on this test, as it differs from those of a typical multiple choice test. Allow approximately 20 minutes.
